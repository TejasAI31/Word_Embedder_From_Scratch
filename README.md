The following is an implementation of CBOW Word Embeddings using my C++ Library.

Some sample outputs have been kept with 2010 words and embedding sizes:
i) 32
ii) 64
iii) 128

This is a very memory intensive program. Embeddings of 128 dimensions over a dataset of 10000 sencences is not recommended for 16GB RAM.
